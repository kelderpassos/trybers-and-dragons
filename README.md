# Welcome to Trybers and Dragons!

 This is a simple project made with the intent to practice my programming logic skills with Typescript and OOP paradigm under SOLID design. 

## Challenges:
- Get used to Typescript's static typing;
- Develop my hability to abstract concepts and translate them into code;
- Code a full application with OOP and instances for the first time;
- Put into practice SOLID design as much as I could;

## Lessons Learned
- Create classes following OOP's features like Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Inheritance and etc;
- Work with interfaces and types of Typescript;
- Using class syntax: getters/setters, methods, constructor...;
